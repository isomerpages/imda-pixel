# Documentation
This documentation will include details on the image sizes, code templates to copy and paste into the actual pages, as well as some tips. 


## Intro & Software Downlaod
This PIXEL website uses Isomer V2. It is written in a mixture of both  

1. **Markdown** (what you are seeing now with * as italic, > as quote, etc) and 
2. **HTML with inline CSS**  (code)

### Markdown
Markdown is what Isomer V2 is all about and is very easy to use. Simply click on the helper buttons at the top of this editor to use the functionalities, or refer to the [Markdown Guide](https://simplemde.com/markdown-guide). 

However, it offers little customisability and functions, such as changing the colour of text or creating a button. Code will be needed for that.

### Code
HTML and CSS are used here. HTML contains the content of the page while CSS determines the style (aesthetics).

It is more complex than markdown but unlocks many possibilities. For example, changing  <span style="background:yellow; color:red"> colour</span> or <span style="font-size:1.3em">font size</span>. The good news is that HTML and CSS are quite readable. Do note the full functionality of typical code is currently not possible in Isomer V2 as there is some super function that overwrites or santises the script, so you may run into scenarios where the code should work on a normal page without Isomer but does not over here in Isomer, and vice versa.

This editor is not the best at supporting the reading and writing of code so downloading a code editor is recommended. It will also help to flag out any errors. Here are some free ones:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

Remember to switch the language to HTML so the coloured text will render correctly.
