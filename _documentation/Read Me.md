# Documentation
This documentation contains details on the image sizes, code templates to copy and paste into the actual pages, as well as some tips. 


## Intro & Software Download
This PIXEL website uses Isomer V2. It is written in a mixture of both  

1. **Markdown** (what you are seeing now with * as italic, > as quote, etc) and 
2. **HTML with inline CSS**  (code)

### Markdown
Markdown is what Isomer V2 is all about and is very easy to use. Simply click on the helper buttons at the top of this editor to use the functionalities, or refer to the [Markdown Guide](https://simplemde.com/markdown-guide). 

However, it offers little customisability and functions, such as changing the colour of text or creating a button. Code will be needed for that.

### Code
HTML and CSS are used. HTML contains the content of the page while CSS determines the style (aka aesthetics). It is more complex than markdown but unlocks many possibilities. For example, changing  <span style="background:yellow; color:red">colour</span> or <span style="font-size:1.3em">font size</span>. The good news is that HTML and CSS are quite readable. 

This editor is not the best at supporting the viewing of code so downloading a code editor is recommended. It will also help to flag out any errors. Here are some free ones:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

Remember to switch the language to HTML so the coloured text will render correctly.

FYI the full functionality of typical code is currently not possible in Isomer V2 as there is some super function that overwrites or santises the script, so you may run into scenarios where a script works on a non-Isomer page but does not work in Isomer, and vice versa.
