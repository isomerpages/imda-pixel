3 innovative Singaporean startups that are transforming the way we live, work, and play
=======================================================================================

Think about companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Canva. They all started out as small startups, developing disruptive, innovative solutions that addressed real-world problems and changed up the way things work.

However, the startup life is not easy. Even as companies pursue these innovations, they face numerous hurdles such as raising funds and building credibility.

Fortunately, governments are well aware of how they can make a difference for startups and the importance of innovation. Singapore’s [Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)](https://www.imda.gov.sg/), for one, has enacted a comprehensive set of programs and schemes to support young companies on their journeys.

When Ani Bhalekar was a junior partner with McKinsey & Company, he used to travel frequently. All the time spent on the road made it difficult for him to develop a regular workout routine. While he could exercise on his own using fitness apps, he wasn’t sure if he was going about it the right way.
