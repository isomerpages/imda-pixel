				<br><span style="font-size:1.em; line-height:1em; color:grey"> Amazing team - very helpful and truly wants the community and companies to succeed. Here are are my top 3 favs: <br>
1) The PIXEL team - Always ready to help, support. Responsive to our needs and understands the importance of cultivating the tech/innovation/entrepreneurship community. <br>
2) The space - Amazing for us to do demos, workshops and learning sessions, including the AR/VR lab space. <br>
3) The program - the amount of seminars, workshops designed to really help budding companies and entrepreneurs is impressive. It's also diverse and impactful. <br>
All these is crucial in helping us to grow, launch our product and forge really key partnerships.

				<br><span style="font-size:1.em; line-height:1em; color:grey"> Since our founding, Hiverlab has received a wide range of support from IMDA PIXEL. Some examples are venue booking for events, equipment & facilities for projects and product development (e.g. studios, and most recently the 5G testbed), business matching (e.g. with schools, research institutions, companies), publicity (e.g. media coverage, online sharing with IMDA Pixel community), and more. The programs are informative and flexible, and the program managers are very approachable and supportive to startups.</span>
