I've been consistently impressed with the professional support from everyone on the team. They have taken steps to make us feel welcome, offer valuable advice and even come to the rescue multiple times. Truly a world class facility and support team.</span>

				<br><span style="font-size:1.em; line-height:1em; color:grey"> IMDA PIXEL is that collaborative space where our talent could not only get a home - but also be exposed to collaboration that helped us bring a superior product to market, in multiple ways. Through PIXEL we met one of our first content creator partners. At PIXEL we also met the UXD consultancy that helped us build our revolutionary UI which is actively being used by a number of our clients and their end users. To engage the consultancy we used one of the schemes of IMDA which subsidised the cost of engaging that consultancy by 70%. IMDA Spark also validated our B2B approach by evaluating our tech, commercials and viability. Because of IMDA PIXEL, our product became significantly better because of world-class facilities for our team to work in, great content powered by the creator economy, a terrific user experience and significant credibility for us at our B2B clients!</span>

The programs are informative and flexible, and the program managers are very approachable and supportive to startups.</span>

				<br><span style="font-size:1.em; line-height:1em; color:grey"> Through PIXEL’s business matching process, we were connected to local start-ups and get to collaborate with them in the areas of MR, AI/Data, Internet of Things and 5G. The ecosystem of innovation community is well established for corporates and local start-ups to tap on each others’ expertise and business network. We have been able to work with a few start-ups to build user-centric solutions for regional and global clients, and PIXEL has been very supportive in ensuring that we have a smooth sailing collaboration.
