### Pixel Perfect: A Photo Essay of What Working Is Like at IMDA’s Innovation Hub

##### For a place called Pixel, it definitely doesn’t have a tiny vibe to it.

Located in the heart of the One-north district in Singapore, Pixel is an innovation hub developed by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to encourage corporate innovation and help startups scale. It’s got everything that corporates dabbling in digital innovation and tech startups could want: a community event space, co-working facilities, AR and VR labs, UI and UX labs, recreational areas, and more. 

Of course, facilities are but one part of the equation. If office areas were all startups wanted, any co-working space would do. Based on what I’ve heard, however, Pixel seems to be attractive to businesses for reasons beyond the physical.
