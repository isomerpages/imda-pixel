            <br>As the complexity of urban routines and major events increases, planning and managing of crowd flow become a necessity. Large crowds in high densities poses high risk of stampede. An agent-based simulation allows for evaluation of scenarios and mitigation strategies that cannot be efficiently validated in the physical environment. It provides a way to simulate scenarios to optimize new estate design, improve crowd flow, and prepare for dispersal during emergency situations. AWS SimSpace Weaver is a managed service offering from AWS which enables large-scale dynamic entities simulation. It speeds up realistic crowd simulations with human-like agent behavior, enabling faster decision-making.
