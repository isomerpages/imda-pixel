            <br><b>Meta</b>
            <br>We partnered Meta and have run two seasons of the Facebook Accelerator programme from February 2019 to September 2020. Over six months, we incubate and support innovative data-driven start-ups in developing data innovation models for Asia and the rest of the world, Meta offered mentorship, training and support in using data in live environments. PIXEL provided the co-working space and access to creative design consultants for start-ups to collaborate, build and access key markets. The Facebook Accelerator programme is Meta’s second data innovation start-up programme globally, after France, and the first in Asia.
					<br><br>From 2022 – 2023, we partnered with the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC), and the TTC Labs team at Meta to run the Data Privacy Accelerator. A series of Design Jams were conducted in Singapore on the topic of data transparency in XR and the metaverse, along with PIXEL’s community of start-ups i.e. BuzzAR, InteractAI, Meshminds and Smobler Studios. Insights garnered have been published in the <a href="https://www.ttclabs.net/report/data-transparency-and-control-in-the-metaverse" target="_blank">report</a> “Data transparency and control in XR and the metaverse”, which provides a forward-looking view of the key design considerations and opportunities for data transparency and control in XR and the metaverse.

		    <br><b>NVIDIA</b> 
            <br>We are in collaboration with Nvidia to bring expert resources on the Omniverse Platform to our start-ups and tech community.
