### Building a Transparent World - How Hiverlab empowers next generation digital infrastruture 

Meet the team behind Jewel-rassic Quest, the large-scale augmented reality (AR) experience at Jewel Changi Airport, a project which has been recognized as a global benchmark - immersive tech start-up, [Hiverlab](https://www.hiverlab.com/).

"Life is like a marathon." When Hiverlab took off from the starting line in 2014, they set their eye on a niche with very few players, which is the space of extended reality (XR). After almost a decade since their founding, the team noted that buzzwords have evolved from XR to DigitalTwins, or Web3.0, or Metaverse, and recently AIGC (including DALL-E, ChatGPT, etc.). Ignoring the noise from the fast-changing trends, the Hiverlab team remains laser-focused on what they have set out to achieve – and these are backed by insights they gleaned from each market cycle.

However, the road to achieving the team’s big dreams wasn’t always a bed of roses as it often comes down to the nitty-gritty tasks and details in their daily working life. One piece of advice they wished someone had told them earlier was to remind themselves to “dress up for formal business meetings, instead of showing up in shorts and t-shirts”! Let this be a reminder to all our brilliant founders out there!
