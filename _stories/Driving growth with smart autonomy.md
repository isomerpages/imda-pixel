### Driving growth with smart autonomy

###### With support from robotics navigation specialist Movel AI, biotech firm Amgen is using smart vehicles in its factory to boost worker safety and efficiency

At biotech giant Amgen’s biomanufacturing facility in Tuas, smart vehicles with forklifts navigate the factory floor on their own, lifting and carrying large totes of drug substances, each weighing as much as three tonnes, from one area to another.

By leveraging such vehicles, called automated guided vehicles (AGVs), Amgen raised productivity and optimised manpower use, compared to the previous method of using human-operated forklifts to move the totes. 

The AGVs take the safest and most efficient pathway through the facility and avert the need to allocate manpower to transport the totes, resulting in better resource utilisation, says Amgen Singapore Manufacturing’s information systems director Vincent Tan.

“Through the use of sensors and cameras, the AGVs can increase productivity and reduce cost by eliminating accidental damage caused by human operators,” he adds.

“Most importantly, by minimising human errors, they prevent injuries and improve our workers’ safety, especially in tight and confined spaces. The fact that the AGVs are electric vehicles, and thus more sustainable, is another big plus,”
he says.

Amgen partnered with local start-up Movel AI, which specialises in robotics navigation solutions for single robots and
fleets of over 100 of them, to develop the solution. It found Movel AI through the Infocomm Media Development Authority’s (IMDA) Open Innovation Platform (OIP). The OIP is a virtual crowd-sourcing platform that connects businesses facing challenges with relevant technology providers.

“We turned to the OIP because it offers easier and faster crowdsourcing and ensures the right fit of vendors from a diverse pool of technology providers.
