For real estate giant CapitaLand Development (CLD), artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed a crucial process of its business – inspection of its properties before launch.

In the past, the company’s project managers, contractors and other specialists walked the ground in individual and joint inspections to examine the quality of materials, scrutinise the workmanship of finished portions and pinpoint areas that can be perfected. The teams also met regularly to share images captured during these site walks to align on problems and solutions.

When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, however, safety restrictions forced the joint inspection teams to split into smaller groups and stagger the site walks. This led to long and costly delays in defect identification and rectification. To solve this issue, CLD turned to the Infocomm Media Development Authority’s (IMDA) Open Innovation Platform (OIP). The OIP is a virtual crowd-sourcing platform that connects businesses facing a challenge with relevant solutions providers.
