### **Pixel Perfect: A Photo Essay of What Working Is Like at IMDA’s Innovation Hub**

###### **On top of cutting-edge facilities, Pixel provides other advantages such as business connections and consultations to help firms scale.**

For a place called Pixel, it definitely doesn’t have a tiny vibe to it.

Located in the heart of the One-north district in Singapore, Pixel is an innovation hub developed by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to encourage corporate innovation and help startups scale. It’s got everything that corporates dabbling in digital innovation and tech startups could want: a community event space, co-working facilities, AR and VR labs, UI and UX labs, recreational areas, and more. 

Of course, facilities are but one part of the equation. If office areas were all startups wanted, any co-working space would do. Based on what I’ve heard, however, Pixel seems to be attractive to businesses for reasons beyond the physical. 

As [one of the leading launchpads](https://e27.co/alibaba-clouds-final-nominees-for-asiastar-10x10-campaign-20221103/) for innovation in Southeast Asia, Pixel has a team to support the digital innovation efforts of large and small businesses through tailored consultations and networking opportunities, connecting startups’ solutions to corporates’ innovation needs. 

To get a better picture of what Pixel does for the local tech community, I spent a full work day there.

Arriving early in the morning, I sneak a quick look into the main working area to see what it’s like. Everything from the color scheme to the chairs and desks are a far cry from the dull and dreary designs that are all too common in office setups. 

It also reminds me of my university days, with different ideas being shared between people who are eager to learn from each other and have a high drive to succeed.

##### A shared Love for Tech

Today, I’m attending several sessions hosted by IMDA and Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provide insights on scaling in the software-as-a-service industry. Participants stream in early, and it’s not long before the room is filled with conversation. 

Some seem like old friends, while I can tell that others have just met for the first time, judging from their boisterous introductions. Lots of handshakes go around, and everyone seems to have that glint in their eye from being part of something they’re passionate about.
