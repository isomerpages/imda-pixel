### To Zero and Beyond with Zuno Carbon - Helping enterprises attain a green future

Sustainability is now a gold standard for all businesses but can you imagine spending hours typing hundred pieces of data into your spreadsheet manually? As an engineer, the pain of witnessing that pushed Hari Nair, Co-Founder and CEO of [Zuno Carbon](https://www.zunocarbon.com/), to make a change in the sustainability field with his start-up’s inventions.

According to a report by NTUC LearningHub, while more than 90% of Singapore businesses see the importance of sustainability, insufficient budget and lack of manpower are still main hindrances to making the next step. This is where Zuno Carbon tackles the pain point by automating the process of data collection and providing cost-effective end-to-end management solutions that helps their clients, such as Dearborn Singapore, reduce carbon emissions.

“Stay humble and work closely with your team.” - Getting to where they are now wasn’t easy. Founded in January 2020, Zuno Carbon had to build their foundations amidst the turmoil that came with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with support from IMDA PIXEL, the team managed to accelerate their research and strengthen their credibility, which led them to score clients across industries in F&B, automobile, fossil fuels and more.
