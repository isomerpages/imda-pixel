### About the workshop 

Global waste generation isn’t showing any signs of slowing down, and largely as a society, we are still operating via the take-make-waste model. The world needs to drastically overhaul the way we design products, services and systems. “Over 70% of a product’s life-cycle costs and environmental footprint is determined during its design phases.” – Navi Radjou & Jaideep Prabhu in their book Frugal Innovation. 

This presents an immense responsibility on businesses to adopt a fundamentally different approach that can help us transition towards a circular and more sustainable economy.

This 3-hr workshop will take participants through design thinking and circular economic principles to help them integrate these into new ventures they are building.
