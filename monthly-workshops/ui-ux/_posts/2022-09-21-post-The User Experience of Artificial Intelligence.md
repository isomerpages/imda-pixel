### About the workshop 

Artificial Intelligence is at work in our everyday lives in more ways than we can perceive. It already has a significant impact on HR, Healthcare and Commerce systems, and many more. Yet we also know that trust in AI systems is generally low across the globe. How can we use UX design principles to help develop more trust with the people we serve? Come and hear stories from the trenches and exchange experiences around the area of experience, trust and AI systems.
