### About the workshop

Described as “a violent test of morality and humanity”, the premise of hit South Korean Netflix series Squid Game, which generated almost US$900 million in value for the company, revolves around debt-ridden players enlisted to compete in a series of 6 childhood games.

While there may not be any obvious linkages between the gory scenes and managing data projects, the TV series does offer deeper points of reflections around both the soft and hard skills that can be used to drive successful outcomes in your data projects.

Join us to hear creative takes on 6 practical lessons we can pick up from each of the 6 games depicted in the immensely popular drama and how they can be applied to overcome challenges in your next data project.
