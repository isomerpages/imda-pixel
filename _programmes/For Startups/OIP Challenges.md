					<br><b>SBS Transit (SBST)</b>
	        <br>Bus Deployment Personnel (BDP) manages the allocation of parking lots for 200-600 buses for the day. The main challenge faced by BDPs is that the actual sequence of buses returning to the depot does not align with the planned dispatched for the next day, and a lot of manual adjustments and exception handling are needed on the ground.
					<br><br>In this challenge, they are looking for a solution to automate the planning of parking lot allocation and notify Bus Captains of their designated parking lots/zones before or upon arrival at the bus depot. It should also minimise the need for manual allocation of parking lots on the ground and support the timely dispatch of buses.

It should also link the retailers within the train stations to enable cross-selling among the different retailers and enhance commuters’ interaction with Stellar Lifestyle’s offerings.
