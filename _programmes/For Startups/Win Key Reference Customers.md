# AWS-IMDA Joint Innovation Centre

The Joint Innovation Center (JIC) is AWS’s first JIC in Southeast Asia and will be ready in mid-2023. It will serve as an extension of AWS Singapore’s Cloud Innovation Centre[3](https://www.imda.gov.sg/Content-and-News/Media-Releases-and-Speeches/Media-Releases/2022/IMDA-collaborates-with-Amazon-Web-Services-to-strengthen-Innovation-in-Singapore-and-Southeast-Asia#_ftn3), as well as IMDA’s PIXEL and Open Innovation Platform (OIP)[4](https://www.imda.gov.sg/Content-and-News/Media-Releases-and-Speeches/Media-Releases/2022/IMDA-collaborates-with-Amazon-Web-Services-to-strengthen-Innovation-in-Singapore-and-Southeast-Asia#_ftn4) initiatives. The centre will provide enterprises and startups with support to drive innovation through technology education and innovation challenges workshops, opportunities for business growth and scale through AWS and IMDA’s business networks, avenues to showcase their technology use cases, and consultancy using Amazon’s “Working Backwards” methodology – an innovation process that helps an organisation approach a challenge with the end outcome in mind and then rapidly bring that solution to life.

The JIC will support customers to develop solutions using Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), Data and Artificial Intelligence, the Internet-of-Things (IoT), Robotics, and cloud technologies.  Enterprises and startups can access the breadth and depth of more than 200 fully featured AWS services, including AWS’s industry-leading security capabilities and global infrastructure, to drive innovation.

Beyond activities within the JIC, enterprises and startups from AWS’s and IMDA’s networks will be able to better access a larger innovation community through co-innovation labs and events. AWS and IMDA will organise innovation events each year at PIXEL, with the first event being a week-long regional festival of innovation in the first half of 2023.
