### About the workshop 

As Climate Change and Sustainability are leading topics around the world today, and governments are taking action, businesses will have to change and adapt as well. One of the cornerstone ideas of this chance is Circularity - the idea of designing waste out of value chains through new ways of viewing problems.

Design thinking, in its extended form, is a key tool any company can use to work towards a circular economy vision. In this interactive workshop, we will demystify the term circularity, share practical insights and case studies, and provide and apply frameworks and tools that can help participating business leaders take the first step on this important journey.

**Presenting Partner:MING LABS **

MING LABS is a strategic design firm, focused on sustainable growth. We design, we write code, and we love the business side of it all. We are hired to work on new problems together, instead of telling people what they want to hear. We do both strategy & production. To name a few: research, insights, business design, customer journeys, value mapping; UX, prototypes, design, and development.

We're trying to make things work well both for clients who pay for them — and for humans who end up using them. What you’re getting from MING is a team of, say, five people who’ll work with you day in and day out, and they will bring you somewhere new. Which is perhaps exactly where you’d like to end up. Be it new products, services, or ventures, we are up for the challenge. We love to work with aligned incentives, so we win when you win.
