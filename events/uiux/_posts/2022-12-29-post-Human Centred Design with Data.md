### About the workshop 

Data-driven design is often thought of as A/B testing or website analytics, for measuring or evaluating success. But used earlier on, data can also be a powerful creative tool during the discovery and ideation phases of a project. 

In this workshop, you will explore new ways to think with data, and learn how it enables more connected, personalised, and anticipatory experiences for people around the world. Through case studies, discussion and structured activities, you will gain new ways to approach creative problem-solving that can be applied to services, products, environments, supply chains, and more.

For 15+ years, we have been tackling some of the world’s most complex challenges, using design-led human-centred approaches. We design with change leaders from the public, private and the non-profit sector and engage with the complexity and the messiness of real human experiences - how people live, work and play; how people experience products, services, regulations; how they navigate systems they interact with - health, education, energy, economic, regulatory, social welfare, to name a few. Globally, we are a team of over 150 people who are passionate about making the world a better place. ThinkPlace has adopted the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as our guiding purpose
